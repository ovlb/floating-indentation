        <h1>Floating Indentation</h1>
        <p>In traditional, western typesetting paragraphs are mostly indented with a fixed width. The width might change, but in and off itself it is the norm.</p>
        <p>Just as in this intro. Other forms of indentation are possible (e.g. inline with a pilcrow, ¶), but rarely seen.</p>
        <p class="hanging-indent">It is called <em>Hanging Indentation</em> when the first line starts to the left of the following lines. It is common in encyclopaedias. Pretty clever, as you mostly skip through them to find a single word.</p>
        <p>Online, most pages do not indent paragraphs at all, instead they mark them by horizontal space.</p>
        <p>This experiment aims to reproduce an approach that varies the indentation based on the length of the line before.</p>

But few have moved me more than a recent one from a 61-year-old woman from Santa Fe, who has been living with Stage IV cancer for nearly twenty-six years — something she revealed not as a centerpiece of the letter, and not as self-pity or even a complaint, but as a mere factual report for context. She went on to describe all the enlivening ways she has found for leading a rich, creative, and rewarding life as she adjusted to her progressively diminishing physical faculties. Astounded at first by her resilience and optimism given the cards she had been dealt, I was reminded of a now-legendary 1978 adaptation theory study (PDF), which found that both lottery winners and people rendered paraplegic by an accident not only return to their baseline happiness level within a few months but also have similar baselines overall, regardless of whether they had great or terrible fortune.</p>
            <p>And yet most of us find this difficult to believe because, despite what we may know about the psychology of resilience and our hardwired optimism bias, we dread change enormously. Change — be it negative, neutral, or even positive — is hard; more than that, it’s usually unwelcome — in no small part because we’re stitched together by our routines and rituals. But change is also how we stretch ourselves and grow, and in the tension between the resistance and the necessity lies one of the great paradoxes of the human condition.</p>

            <p>The wisest advice I’ve ever encountered on how to assuage our deep discomfort with change comes from Lewis Carroll — a man of timeless and timely insight on so many facets of daily life: In his nine commandments of letter-writing we find guidelines to making modern digital communication more civil, and in his rules for digesting information we find solace for our present state of information overload.</p>
            <p>Although Carroll’s beloved Alice in Wonderland is a story about befriending the disorienting strangeness of change, he addressed the subject directly two decades later. In an August 1885 letter included in the altogether addictive The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll (public library; free download) — which also gave us Carroll’s three tips for overcoming creative block — he writes to a young friend named Isabel Standen, who had written to him lamenting her loneliness and unhappiness in a new environment:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I can quite understand, and much sympathize with, what you say of your feeling lonely, and not what you can honestly call “happy.” Now I am going to give you a bit of philosophy about that — my own experience is, that every new form of life we try is, just at first, irksome rather than pleasant. My first day or two at the sea is a little depressing; I miss [my usual] interests, and haven’t taken up the threads of interest here; and, just in the same way, my first day or two, when I get back [home], I miss the seaside pleasures, and feel with unusual clearness the bothers of business-routine. In all such cases, the true philosophy, I believe, is “wait a bit.” Our mental nerves seem to be so adjusted that we feel first and most keenly, the dis-comforts of any new form of life; but, after a bit, we get used to them, and cease to notice them; and then we have time to realize the enjoyable features, which at first we were too much worried to be conscious of.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Almost a century before that famous adaptation theory study, Carroll illustrates his point with a strikingly similar example:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Suppose you hurt your arm, and had to wear it in a sling for a month. For the first two or three days the discomfort of the bandage, the pressure of the sling on the neck and shoulder, the being unable to use the arm, would be a constant worry. You would feel as if all comfort in life were gone; after a couple of days you would be used to the new sensations, after a week you perhaps wouldn’t notice them at all; and life would seem just as comfortable as ever.</p>
                <p>So my advice is, don’t think about loneliness, or happiness, or unhappiness, for a week or two. Then “take stock” again, and compare your feelings with what they were two weeks previously. If they have changed, even a little, for the better you are on the right track; if not, we may begin to suspect the life does not suit you. But what I want specially to urge is that there’s no use in comparing one’s feelings between one day and the next; you must allow a reasonable interval, for the direction of change to show itself. Sit on the beach, and watch the waves for a few seconds; you say “the tide is coming in “; watch half a dozen successive waves, and you may say “the last is the lowest; it is going out.” Wait a quarter of an hour, and compare its average place with what it was at first, and you will say “No, it is coming in after all.” …</p>
                <p>With love, I am always affectionately yours,</p>
                <p>C.L. Dodgson</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Origin of the species: where did Darwin's finches come from?</h2>
            <p>When the first of the Galápagos Islands arose from the ocean floor around 3m years ago, they were naked, angry, lava-spewing
                cones devoid of life. Now, millions of years later, they are alive with some of the world’s most iconic animals.
                Giant tortoises. Sea iguanas. Flightless cormorants. And those finches equipped with Swiss army knife beaks.</p>
            <p>The Galápagos finches are probably one of the most well-known examples of evolution and will forever be tightly linked
                to Charles Darwin’s voyage and his theory of natural selection (although you may be surprised to learn that the Galápagos
                finches were
                <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A932&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1" data-link-name="in body link"
                    class="u-underline">not as central to Darwin’s theory</a> as we like to think). With their diversity of bill sizes and shapes, each species
                has adapted to a specific type of food; the ground-finch (
                <em>Geospiza</em>) has a thick beak adapted to feeding on a variety of crunchy seeds and arthropods, whereas the warbler
                finch (
                <em>Certhidea olivacea</em>) developed a slender, pointy bill to catch tasty insects hiding between the foliage. The
                woodpecker finch
                <em> </em>(
                <em>Camarhynchus pallidus</em>)
                <em> </em>even uses twigs or cactus spines to pry arthropods out of treeholes.</p>
            <p>The Galápagos finches are seen as a classic example of an adaptive radiation, the rapid evolution of ecologically different
                species from a common ancestor. Comparisons of anatomical features of the Galápagos finches, as well as modern molecular
                techniques, show they are indeed more closely related to each other than to any other species. This means they form
                a monophyletic group, a group of organisms all descended from one ancestral species. Based on the accumulated differences
                that occurred in their DNA over time (a way of estimating when species split from each other), the ancestral flock
                likely reached the Galápagos about 2-3m years ago (Grant and Grant, 2008). What did those very first finches look
                like? And where did they come from?</p>
            <p>Although many of the Galápagos Islands themselves are several million years old, the oldest known fossil remains of Galápagos
                finches come from the Holocene period (the last 10,000 years) (Steadman et al, 1991). These fossils are from two
                species of ground-finches,
                <em>Geospiza nebulosi </em>and
                <em>G magnirostris</em>, that are still living on the islands today. They thus tell us little about what the earliest
                finches looked like and where they might have come from.</p>
            <p>Because of the islands’ close proximity to Ecuador, scientists have looked towards mainland South America in their search
                for the ancestor of the Galápagos finches. The avian palaeontologist David Steadman argued, based on morphological
                and behavioural similarities (1982), that the blue-back grassquit
                <em>Volatinia jacarina</em>, a small tropical bird common throughout much of Central and South America, was the most
                likely direct ancestor of the Galápagos finches. Later studies, such as that of Sato et al. (2001), started using
                mitochondrial DNA and found that another species of grassquit,
                <em>Tiaris obscura, </em>was the most likely ancestral species. This species originated in Central America, but spread
                into South America as the Isthmus of Panama, the land bridge between North and South America, formed around 3m years
                ago. From South America, it made its way to the archipelago.</p>
            <p>However, others have argued, based on similarities in morphology as well as behaviour, that the Galápagos finches are
                more closely related to Caribbean species of
                <em>Tiaris </em>or the Saint Lucia black finch
                <em>Melanospiza richardsoni </em>(Baptista and Trail, 1988). This possibility of a Caribbean origin of the Galápagos
                finches was also corroborated by a recent analysis (Funk and Burns, 2018). In this analysis, the majority of species
                most closely related to the Galápagos finches were found to have their ancestral range in the Caribbean. However,
                the analysis was not conclusive, and there remains an equal probability of a Caribbean origin or a South American
                mainland origin to the Darwin’s finch radiation.</p>
            <p> A Caribbean origin of the Galápagos finches seems counterintuitive, as the nearest mainland from the Galápagos is South
                America, but dispersal does not always follow a straight line. This is nicely demonstrated by the finch that inhabits
                nearby Cocos Island,
                <em>Pinaroloxias inornata</em>. Although this island is closer to the mainland than the Galápagos Islands themselves,
                genetic research has shown that the Cocos Island finch descended from a Galápagos species, not a mainland one (Grant
                and Grant, 2008).</p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/birds" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag"
                    class="u-underline">Birds</a> are excellent long-distance dispersers, even over open ocean, as demonstrated by the repeated colonisation
                of the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand. Moreover, other Galápagos birds, such as mockingbirds and the Galápagos
                flamingo, exhibit similar Caribbean connections, indicating that a Caribbean origin is plausible. Remarkably enough,
                this pattern has also been found in other animal groups, such as snakes, moths and sponges (Grehan 2001). Thus the
                Caribbean remains as a likely source for the origin of Galápagos finches.</p>
            <p>Although the lack of fossils means that we don’t know much about the appearance of the first finches, we can narrow down
                their area of origin. The closure of the Panama land bridge altered ocean circulation, and probably brought about
                changes in wind strength and directions. These changes may have facilitated the colonisation of the Galápagos Islands,
                especially if that area was the point of departure for a flock of adventurous finches.</p>
